About last week:

#1 COMMENTS:

How i do comments in HTML? 

<!-- -->
<! -- this line will be a comment and it is only for my documentation -->

how i do comments in JavaScripts? 

// 
and 
/*   */ 
// that´s is really useful for comment one line

/* in this form
i can do more lines
important is, that we have to close the comment */

secuence caracter
 /n = new line
 /" = doble quote
 // = backslash


#2 ARRAYS: 
array with 5 integer number
let my_arr = [24,11,29,3,45]

arrays can contain different types. for example integer and strings  
let my_arr_two = [1,"hello", 3];

arrays can contain maybe another or multiples arrays
let arrays_with_another_array = ["hello", 1, [23, "anotherArray", 54]];
 
the first posicion in an array is 0 !!
let´s the my_arr. 
my_arr[0]; -> the first position of my_array, the output? 24
my_arr[4]; output 45
my_arr[6]; out of range. Maybe will be give you a Error! 

waht is about the array with another array?
let´s take on time more this array. 
let arrays_with_another_array = ["hello", 1, [23, "anotherArray", 54]];

arrays_with_another_array[0]; //output "hello" 
arrays_with_another_array[2][0]; //output 23 
arrays_with_another_array[2][1]; //output "anotherArray" 


#3 OBJETS:

for object you have a key and a value. In different like array you can access to the value if you use the key. There is not postition here

let d = [1, 2, 3, "four", [45, 46, "seven"]];

let obj_2 = {
      thing_1: 1,//key : value
      anotherthing: d, //array as value

- we created a object with the name obj_2
- we created two keys thing_1 and anothering
- thing_1 has the value 1
- anotherthing has the value d, what is an array 

obj_2.thing_1 will you return the value 1


#4 CLASSES:

think about: you have multiples <div> </div> marquee or another <marquee> 
your CSS code look like:

div 
{
  text-align: center;
  color:brown;
}
whats happend? all the div will get this change. But wo can we do the change to a specific seccion? 
Classes is a good option!

HTML Code
<div>
<h1 class= "my_class"> Here ist the main Titel <br></h1>
</div>

CSS Code

.my_class 
{
  text-align: center;
  color:brown;
}

-In HTML Code we created a class with the name my_class. 
-In CSS Code we call the class my_class. Don´t forget the dot before the name of the class
